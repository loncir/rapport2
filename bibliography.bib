  abstract = "PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the effects of three
              different high-intensity training (HIT) models, balanced for
              total load but differing in training plan progression, on
              endurance adaptations. METHODS: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen
              uptake (V˙O2peak) 61.3 $\pm$ 5.8 mL·kg·min) were randomized to
              three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training
              program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of
              low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing
              HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 $\times$ 16
              min in weeks 1-4, 4 $\times$ 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 $\times$ 4
              min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed
              interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the
              increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed
              the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all
              mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session
              efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmol·L
              blood lactate in 4 $\times$ 16-, 4 $\times$ 8-, and 4 $\times$
              4-min sessions, respectively (P 0.05). Further, an individual
              response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large,
              moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each
              training group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
              organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
              mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk
              training period has little or no effect on training adaptation
              when the overall training load is the same.",

              dosing (GWP) vs. whey protein (WP) or maltodextrin (MALTO) dosed
              once daily during 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training
              (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5
              $\pm$ 3 years; mean $\pm$ SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein
              frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2
              lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from
              10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is
              the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants
              were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or
              GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation
              occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
              (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for
              muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy
              (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3
              (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for
              immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the
              greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p
              < 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass
              [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p < 0.05).
              However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase
              in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p < 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups
              experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber
              cross-sectional area (~+300 $\mu$m2). When examining the effects
              of training on LBM increases ($\Delta$LBM) in all participants
              combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p < 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85
              kg, p < 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting
              $\Delta$LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to
              remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was
              observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p < 0.001) but not MID to
              POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP
              supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body
              composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases
              observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP
              supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal
              muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program,
              ECW-corrected $\Delta$LBM gains were largely dampened, but still
              positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded ~20
              sets/exercise/wk.",

               biomarkers between previously-trained low versus high
               hypertrophic responders in response to resistance training.
               Herein, 30 college-aged males (training age 5 $\pm$ 3 years;
               mean $\pm$ SD) partook in 6 weeks of high-volume resistance
               training. Body composition, right leg vastus lateralis (VL)
               biopsies, and blood were obtained prior to training (PRE) and at
               the 3-week (W3) and 6-week time points (W6). The 10 lowest (LOW)
               and 10 highest (HIGH) hypertrophic responders were clustered
               based upon a composite hypertrophy score of PRE-to-W6 changes in
               right leg VL mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), VL
               thickness assessed via ultrasound, upper right leg lean soft
               tissue mass assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and
               mid-thigh circumference. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare
               biomarker differences between the LOW and HIGH clusters over
               time, and stepwise linear regression was performed to elucidate
               biomarkers that explained significant variation in the composite
               hypertrophy score from PRE to W3, W3 to W6, and PRE to W6 in all
               30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a
               composite hypertrophy change of +10.7 $\pm$ 3.2 and -2.1 $\pm$
               1.6\%, respectively (p W3 > PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE >
               W3\&W6), pan-mTOR (PRE > W3 W3 W3 W3), muscle ubiquitin-labeled
               proteins (PRE > W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6 > W3\&PRE),
               45S rRNA (PRE > W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE >
               W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned
               biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome
               activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor
               protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase).
               Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R 2
               = 0.152, $\beta$ = 0.390, p = 0.033) and PRE type II fCSA (R 2 =
               0.207, $\beta$ = -0.455, p = 0.019) best predicted the PRE-to-W6
               change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size
               is limited, these data suggest: (a) HIGH responders may exhibit
               more growth potential given that they possessed lower PRE type
               II fCSA values and (b) possessing a greater type II fiber
               percentage as a trained individual may be advantageous for
               hypertrophy in response to resistance training.",
